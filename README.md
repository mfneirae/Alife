In this repository you will find a compilation of class notes and useful concepts that could help to understand the bases the course of Artificial Life oriented by [Jonathan Gomez Perdomo](http://dis.unal.edu.co/~jgomezpe/) in the [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](http://unal.edu.co/).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

To use this scripts is neccesary to install the next libraries to your python:
```
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
```

## Useful Definitions:
Here you will find some resumed definitions that are needed to understand the basics of the final project.
### What is life?
Life could be defined as a space-time patron that could be able to be moved to another environment and fights against the entropy second law.
### What is Intelligence?
Intelligence could be defined as the ability to solve problems.
### What is Artificial?
Something could be called artificial if to exist requires to be mediated for intelligence
### Define a Complex System
A network composed of multiple individuals of the same kind that only interact locally.
### Define a Complicated System
A network composed of multiple individuals for all kinds that interact in a global way.
### What is a Fractal?
Geometrocal objects generally with non integer dimension that haves self-similarity (contains infinite copies of itself).

### Fractal dimension
Fractals in generall have non integer dimension, for example, using the Koch curve we could demostrate that:
* A line has only one dimension:

* A square has only two dimensions:
* A cube has only three dimensions:
